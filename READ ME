Final Project

I worked with Gabby McGinn and Matthew Wallace on this assignment

This assignment took us about a week to complete

I really liked this assignment because it allowed for us to be practical in our
knowledge of coding and we used what we knew to implement a code that could be
useful to the other members at Ursinus College

No concerns for me! Thanks for a great semester!
